git commit -m"the message you want to give during commit"
git push
git clone <url of the GitHub repository you want to clone>
git rebase (if needed)


#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter the input n " n
for ((i=1;i<=n;i++))
do
            for ((j=1;j<i+1;j++))
            do
                       echo -n "*"
           done
           echo ""

done
